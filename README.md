# My dotfiles

This is my collection of dotfiles for a customized Arch Linux desktop environment using Hyprland on Wayland.

I started with [Arch Linux](https://archlinux.org/) and got into ricing, I was running Arch for a couple of months but I wanted to try [Omarchy](https://github.com/basecamp/omarchy) for a bit.

Realised pretty quickly that I didn’t like a lot of the decisions, keybinds or pre-installed apps. Rather than fighting with it by tinkering with the provided config files, I decided to go back to Arch and take only what I liked from Omarchy:
- Config structure
- **[Unified clipboard](https://learn.omacom.io/2/the-omarchy-manual/105/universal-clipboard)**
- **[Capture](https://learn.omacom.io/2/the-omarchy-manual/53/hotkeys#capture)**
- **[Quick Emojis](https://learn.omacom.io/2/the-omarchy-manual/53/hotkeys#quick-emojis)**
- **[Themes & Theme switcher](https://learn.omacom.io/2/the-omarchy-manual/52/themes)**
- **[Elephant custom menus](https://github.com/abenz1267/elephant)**
- **[Walker](https://github.com/abenz1267/walker)**
- **[Nautilus](https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/nautilus)**

The setup has configurations for:

- **[Hyprland](https://github.com/hyprwm/Hyprland)** with **[Waybar](https://github.com/Alexays/Waybar)** and **[Mako](https://github.com/emersion/mako)**
